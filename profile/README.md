Actionfile
----------

An _Actionfile_ is a Markdown-based configuration file that describes a set of actions, scripts, or tasks for use in automation workflows, dotfile management, or application deployment. It is designed for human readability and machine parsing, combining documentation, configuration, and executable code blocks in one file.


### Implementations

  - [action.sh](https://github.com/actionfile/action.sh)
  - [action.js](https://github.com/actionfile/action.js)

### Alternative implementations

The following has specific changes that I use for my own [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.gbraad.nl)

  - [`action.zsh`](https://github.com/gbraad-dotfiles/upstream/blob/main/zsh/.zshrc.d/action.zsh) and fuzzy launcher [`actions.md`](https://github.com/gbraad-dotfiles/applications/blob/main/actions.md)
  - [`app.zsh`](https://github.com/gbraad-dotfiles/upstream/blob/main/zsh/.zshrc.d/app.zsh) which performs `OS` and `packager`-detection and fuzzy launcher: [`apps.md`](https://github.com/gbraad-dotfiles/applications/blob/main/apps.md)
